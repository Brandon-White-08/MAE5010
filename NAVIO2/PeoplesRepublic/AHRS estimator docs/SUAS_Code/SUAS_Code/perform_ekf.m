%
% PERFORM_EKF implements a full-state discrete-time Extended Kalman Filter
% for a non-linear system and/or measurement model (See References 1 & 2).  
% System models are often derived as continuous-time models, where the 
% propagation of a state vector x(t) is defined by its time-derivative 
% xdot(t) (derivative of x(t) with respect to time).  At any time t, 
% xdot(t) must be modeled as a function of the system state, x(t), other 
% deterministic quantities (u(t)) that are not otherwise modeled in x(t), 
% and any non-deterministic influences, w(t).  Similarly, a non-linear 
% measurement vector, z(t), can also be modeled as a function of 
% x(t), u(t), and non-deterministic influences v(t).  Thus, a 
% continuous-time system to be estimated by a non-linear Kalman Filter 
% method can by modeled by:
%
%    Non-Linear Continuous-Time Model
%    --------------------------------
%    xdot(t) = f(x(t),u(t)) + w(t),           E(w(t)*w(t)')=Q(t)
%    z(t)    = h(x(t),u(t)) + v(t),           E(v(t)*v(t)')=R(t)
%
% In the Continuous-Time Model, f() and h() are functions representing the 
% state dynamics and measurement models, respectively.  Also, the state
% process noise, w(t), and the measurement noise, v(t), have statistical
% covariance matrices Q(t) and R(t), respectively. [E(w*w') is the expected
% value of the matrix w*w'. E(w*w') is also called the covariance of w.]
%
% But, the Extended Kalman Filter is based on a linearization of the
% non-linear system.  For the implemented full-state EKF, the system
% is linearized about the estimated state vector.  Thus, the
% continuous-time linearized system can be represented as:
%
%    Linearized Continuous-Time Model
%    --------------------------------
%    xdot(t) = F(t)*x(t) + Fu(t)*u(t) + w(t),    E(w(t)*w(t)')=Q(t)
%    z(t)    = H(t)*x(t) + Hu(t)*u(t) + v(t),    E(v(t)*v(t)')=R(t)
%
%    where:
%       F(t) = Jacobian of f(x,u) with respect to x(t) (Linearized mapping from x(t) to xdot(t).)
%       H(t) = Jacobian of h(x,u) with respect to x(t) (Linearized mapping from x(t) t z(t).)
%       Fu(t)= Jac. of f(x,u) wrt u(t). (Fu(t) is not explicitly needed because xdot(t) will be formed from f(x,u).)
%       Hu(t)= Jac. of h(x,u) wrt u(t). (Hu(t) is not explicitly needed because z(t) will be formed from h(x,u).)
%
% Finally, Kalman Filters are generally implemented in the discrete-time
% domain, thus the above continuous-time model must be converted to
% discrete time, where "k" indicates the time step:
%
%    Linearized Discrete-Time Model
%    --------------------------------
%    x(k+1)  = PHI(k)*x(k) + PHIu(k)*u(k) + w(k),   E(w(k)*w(k)')=Q(k)
%    z(k)    = H(k)  *x(k) + Hu(k)  *u(k) + v(k),   E(v(k)*v(k)')=R(k)
%
%    where:
%      PHI(k):  State Transition Matrix from time k to time k+1 
%               (PHI(k) is determined via VanLoan method, described later.)
%      H(k):    Linear mapping from states to measurement at time k
%               (H(k) is equal to H(t) at time k.)
%      Q(k):    Covariance of discrete-time process noise w(k) 
%               (Q(k) is not equal to inputted Q(t).  Q(k) is determined via VanLoan method.)
%      R(k):    Covariance of the sampled (discrete-time) measurement noise v(k). 
%      PHIu(k): Mapping from u(k) to x(k+1). (Not explicitly needed)
%      Hu(k):   Mapping from u(k) to z(k). (Not explicitly needed)
%
% The purpose of the Kalman Filter is to provide an estimate of x given
% measurements z.  In EKF parlance, the estimate of x is denoted xhat.
% Similarly, the estimate of the measurement z recreated from xhat is
% denoted zhat.  [For a linear measurement: zhat=H*xhat+Hu*u. For a 
% non-linear measurement: zhat=h(xhat,u).]
%
% To accomodate a wide array of system models with either linear or
% non-linear state dynamics and measurement models, PERFORM_EKF requires
% handles to user-provided functions to generate the dynamics and 
% measurement models:
%
%      @compute_xdot_and_F:  [xdot F] = compute_xdot_and_F(xhat,u1,u2,...,uN)
%         This function must return both the nx1 state derivative vector, 
%         xdot, and the nxn continuous-time linearized dynamics matrix, F.  
%         The inputs to the function are the current state estimates, xhat,
%         and any number of additional inputs (u1,...,uN), as necessary.  
%
%      @compute_zhat_and_H:  [zhat H] = compute_zhat_and_H(xhat,u1,u2,...,uN)
%         This function must return both a model-based estimate (zhat) of 
%         the mx1 measurement vector z and the mxn linearized measurement 
%         matrix H.  The inputs to the function are the current state  
%         estimates, xhat, and any number of additional inputs (u1,...,uN), 
%         as necessary.
%
% Note that @compute_xdot_and_F and @compute_zhat_and_H must use the exact 
% same input arguments: (xhat,u1,u2,...,uN).
%
% Using the inputted quantities, the EKF is performed in the following
% manner:
%
%    1) The Van Loan method (see Refs. 1 & 3) is used to numerically 
%       convert the continuous-time linearized dynamics model and process 
%       noise matrices, F(t) and Q(t), into the discrete-time state 
%       transition matrix, PHI(k), and discrete-time process noise, Q(k):
%          [F(t), Q(t), dt] => [PHI(k), Q(k)]
%
%    2) The state estimate vector at time k, xhat(k), is propagated dt  
%       seconds via the modeled state derivatives vector, xdot (using Euler
%       integration):
%          xhat(k+1) = xhat(k) + xdot*dt;
%
%    3) The state covariance matrix at time k, P(k), is propagated dt
%       seconds via the state transition matrix, PHI(k), and the
%       discrete-time process noise, Q(k):
%          P(k+1) = PHI(k)*P(k)*PHI(k)' + Q(k)
%
%    4) If a measurement is supplied (i.e. z_k is not empty), the
%       propagated state estimate, xhat(k+1), and covariance, P(k+1), are
%       updated based on the measurement.  The update steps are as follows:
%
%          a) Form the Kalman gain matrix, K, which forms a matrix
%             weighting the state uncertainties, P(k+1), with the
%             measurement uncertainty, R(k).
%                K = P(k+1)*H'*inv(H*P(k+1)*H'+R(k))
%
%          b) Update state estimate at time k+1 using the residual error
%             between the actual measurement, z, and the model of that
%             measurement, zhat.  The Kalman gain K dictates how much the
%             measurement will affect the state estimate:
%                xhat(k+1) = xhat(k+1) + K*(z-zhat)
%
%          c) Upate state covariance matrix at time k+1.  Effectively, this
%             update reduces the state uncertainties due to information
%             gained in the measurement:
%                P(k+1) = (I - K*H)*P(k+1)   (Note: I is the identity matrix)
%
% Notes:
%  - Kalman filtering nomenclature varies widely.  The variable usage
%    herein mostly follows that used in Reference 1.
%  - The theoretical EKF formulation, as represented here, involves 
%    a matrix inverse.  Matrix inversion is highly inefficient and
%    can result in numerical errors.  Other methods, such as Cholesky
%    Factorization, are generally preferred.  (See Reference 4)
