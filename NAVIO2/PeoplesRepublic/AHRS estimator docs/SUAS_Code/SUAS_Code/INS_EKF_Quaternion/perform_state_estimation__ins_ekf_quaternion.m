% UAV state estimation example: INS using quaternions
%
% This routine is a quaternion-based implementation of the "Full GPS 
% Inertial Navigation System" state estimation method described in
% Reference 1.  Specifically, this method uses a 16-state Extended Kalman
% Filter to estimate the UAV position, velocity, and attitude states, 
% while simultaneously estimating gyro and accelerometer biases.
%
% This routine loops through time to perform state estimation using the UAV
% sensor measurements provided in the uavSensors structure.  (This routine 
% is meant to be executed via the uav_state_estimation.m script.)
%
% The discrete-time Extended Kalman Filter is implemented via the provided 
% perform_EKF() routine.

% NOTE: Working with quaternion states in an EKF can be mathematically
%       daunting.  Here, I tried to minimize the "quaternion math" by
%       converting the quaternion states into a Direction-Cosine-Matrix for
%       use in the state dynamics and measurement models.  A quaternion
%       purist will disagree with the implementation, but I feel it
%       maintains the benefits of quaternions (e.g. avoiding the pitch=90º
%       singularity) while maintaining similarity with the method discussed
%       in Reference 1.
%
% NOTE: In addition to using quaternions, this method differs from the 
%       "Full GPS Inertial Navigation System" method described in 
%       Reference 1 in that it uses the 3D magnetometer unit vector as a
%       measurement instead of a 2D magnetometer yaw measurement.
%
% NOTE: There are many ways to represent rotations.  See
%       rotation_examples.m for background and conversions between the
%       methods.  The methods used herein are:
%         - Euler Angles: [yaw; pitch; roll] of UAV, defining the 
%           transformation from the inertial North-East-Down frame to the 
%           UAV body x-y-z frame.  Rotation order: Z-Y-X, or yaw-about-z,
%           then pitch-about-y, then roll-about-x.
%         - Direction Cosine Matrix (DCM): 3x3 matrix representing the
%           Z-Y-X Euler Angle rotation described above. (Akin to the
%           default rotation order for ANGLE2DCM in the Matlab Aerospace 
%           Toolbox.)  Example:  C_ned2b = Cx(roll)*Cy(pitch)*Cz(yaw).
%         - Quaternions: q=q0+i*q1+j*q2+k*q3, representing the Z-Y-X Euler
%           Angle rotation described above. (Akin to the
%           default rotation order for ANGLE2QUAT in the Matlab Aerospace 
%           Toolbox.)

% Initialize EKF state estimate (xhat) and covariance (P)
%   State estimates, xhat:
%     - Use GPS and magnetometer to provide an initial state estimate.
%     - This method uses a quaternion to represent the attitude of
%       the UAV body frame relative to the fixed North-East-Down frame. 
%       The Euler angle equivalents to this NED-to-body quaternion are yaw,
%       pitch, and roll.
%     - In this method, xhat is a column vector with 16 elements (16x1)
%
%   Covariance, P:
%     - P is a square symmetric matrix, where the nth diagonal element is the
%       variance of the nth state.  The off-diagonal terms represent the
%       covariance between different states.
%     - In this method, P is 16x16.
%     - Although we are initializing the attitude, position and velocity
%       states, we will start the filter with initial uncertainties are 
%       "large" compared to the expected magnitudes of the states.
%     - The EKF designer must use some a priori information to specify
%       the initial uncertainties in the gyro and accelerometer biases
%       (via ekf.sigmas.gyro_bias_rps & ekf.sigmas.accel_bias_mps2).
%     - Using initial uncertainty assumptions (sigmaM for the Mth state),
%       the initial covariance P is a matrix with the square of the
%       uncertainties along the diagonal and zeros in the off-diagonals:
%                  [ sigma1^2    0      ...      0     ]

    % Prepare inputs to Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) routine, perform_ekf().
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    
    % The Extended Kalman Filter is an iterative method for providing an 
    % estimate (xhat) of a true non-linear state vector (x) based on measurements (z).
    % It is assumed that the dynamics of x and the measurement z can be
    % represented as a non-linear continuous-time model:
    %
    %    Non-Linear Continuous-Time Model
    %    --------------------------------
    %    xdot(t) = f(x(t),u(t)) + w(t),           E(w(t)*w(t)')=Q(t)
    %    z(t)    = h(x(t),u(t)) + v(t),           E(v(t)*v(t)')=R(t)
    %
    % where xdot is the time-derivative of x; f() and h() are non-linear
    % functions mapping the state vector x, and possibly other inputs
    % u, into the state derivatives (xdot) and measurement model, 
    % respectively; and w & v are Gaussian processes representing unmodeled 
    % state dynamics process noise and measurement noise, respectively.  
    % Q & R are the covariances of w and v.  In addition to estimating the
    % state vector x, the EKF maintains an error covariance matrix, P,
    % which is a representation of its uncertainty in the estimate of x.
    %
    % Note that the Extended Kalman Filter is based on a linearization of
    % the above non-linear system, and thus requires the linearized
    % dynamics and measurement matrices, F & H, as in:
    %
    %    Linearized Continuous-Time Model
    %    --------------------------------

    % Convert quaternion to yaw, pitch, and roll estimates, as described in
    % Section G of rotation_examples.m.
    %   1) Convert quaternion [q0;q1;q2;q3] into the Direction Cosine Matrix
    %      from North-East-Down (NED) coordinate frame to the body coordinate
    %      frame: C_ned2b (DCM uses Z-Y-X rotation order)
    %   2) Extract roll, pitch, and yaw estimates from DCM:
    %                    [ cos(pitch)cos(yaw)   cos(pitch)sin(yaw)       -sin(pitch)    ]
    %          C_ned2b = [        . . .              . . .          sin(roll)cos(pitch) ]
    %                    [        . . .              . . .          cos(roll)cos(pitch) ]
    %                    Note: the lower left of C_ned2b is not relevant to
    %                    the nominal euler angle extraction.
